\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

\textbf{Background:} Vaes et al.~(2023)\textsuperscript{1} identified 13
symptom clusters in a large cohort of ME/CFS patients. Symptom intensity
is broadly correlated with post-exertional malaise (PEM) severity, with
variation across clusters that seems heterogeneous. Despite this
research, no broadly accepted organizing principle has emerged from this
paper or other attempts at phenotyping ME/CFS.

\textbf{Objective:} To identify and characterize potential subgroups
defined by symptom domain severity relative to PEM within the original
Vaes symptom clusters.

\textbf{Methods:} We analyzed the Vaes cluster summary
data\textsuperscript{2}, calculated geometric means for each symptom
domain within each cluster, and plotted these means against PEM severity
to identify patterns and subgroups.

\textbf{Results:} We identified two groups of patient clusters with
distinct symptom-domain profiles. Separating the 13 clusters into these
subgroups reduced heterogeneity within each. The first group showed a
consistent amplification pattern across all symptom domains as PEM
increased, whereas the second group exhibited selective amplification:
pain and neurocognitive symptoms escalated more rapidly with PEM, while
immune and sleep symptoms remained relatively flat. This subgroup's
profile resembles that of fibromyalgia.

\textbf{Keywords:} Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, ME/CFS, patient
clustering, fibromyalgia, post-exertional malaise, PEM

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Dr.~Anouk W. Vaes and her collaborators at CIRO performed one of the
largest systematic surveys of ME/CFS symptom patterns, applying
clustering methods to patient-reported outcomes to identify recurring
constellations of symptoms\textsuperscript{1}. They used symptom surveys
based on the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire version 2 (DSQ-2) from 337
patients to identify a total of 45 patient clusters of which 13 were of
size \(\geq\) 10. We used the publicly available data of their final 13
clusters for analysis.\textsuperscript{2}

While Vaes described each cluster, and noted some differences among
symptom severity, an overall organizing principle was not proposed.
Other methods have been used to group ME/CFS phenotypes, including by
severity alone, or a combination of severity and symptoms but no
consensus has emerged on how to best group patients.

Our analysis suggests that the Vaes ME/CFS clusters can be organized
into two overarching families defined by their relationship to PEM. This
reduces the complexity of the cluster symptom intensities and highlights
a fibromyalgia-like subgroup within the Vaes clusters that has not been
explicitly recognized in prior work.

According to Vaes\textsuperscript{1}:

\begin{quote}
Almost 90\% of the participants fulfilled the Fukuda case definition,
compared to 80\%, 59\% and 39\% fulfilling the IOM, CCC and ME-ICC case
definitions, respectively. More than a quarter of the participants met
the criteria for all four different case definitions, whilst 5\% of the
participants met none of the abovementioned {[}sp.{]} case
definitions,\ldots{}
\end{quote}

This means the patients in the Vaes study were diagnosed with broad and
different criteria which, when taken together with our analysis,
provides one of the first opportunities to quantitatively separate
classic ME/CFS and fibromyalgia-like patients from a single, uniformly
collected cohort.

\section{Visual Analysis of Symptom Domains
vs.~PEM}\label{visual-analysis-of-symptom-domains-vs.-pem}

The strong weight of PEM symptoms makes the Vaes dataset tricky to
interpret if you only look at raw intensity, so instead we compared
overall symptom levels to PEM severity. From this comparison we
identified two groups of clusters that maintain their integrity across
most symptom domains.

We will start by showing how the groups are most similar, then how they
differ. We add an ``all'' category to gauge overall symptom severity to
the original symptom domains. Our use of the terms ``high'' and ``low
intensity'' does not reproduce the clusters described by Vaes or others
but reflects a new organization based on how symptom domains scale with
PEM. Vaes used the DePaul symptom groupings which we keep as-is.

\textbf{Notes:} The DSQ-2 uses a single symptom for fatigue. Also, for
the ``Overall'' chart we used the arithmetic mean instead of geometric
mean for the Y axis. All other graphs in this study use geometric means
exclusively. Shaded bands represent the 95\% confidence interval of the
linear models when used.

\subsection{Similarities}\label{similarities}

In terms of fatigue, the two groups overlap completely, as ME/CFS
patient clusters are expected to. See Figure~\ref{fig-fatigue}, below.
While the lines have a similar slope and offset we note the R² value is
significantly weaker in the low intensity group (0.54 vs.~0.86).

\begin{figure}[h]

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{VaesSubgroups_files/figure-pdf/fatigue-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-fatigue}Fatigue vs.~PEM}

\end{figure}%

\FloatBarrier

While fatigue shows complete overlap in our groups the next charts
(Figure~\ref{fig-symptoms}) show how they stand out. In the first chart
(top left) we compare the average of all symptoms to PEM. In this chart
one can easily discern two tiers of clusters. One has a higher overall
symptom burden at any given PEM level compared to the other and this
relationship is where we derive the names for our groups: high and low
intensity.

Autonomic, Neuroendocrine and Other also follow a similar pattern:
Parallel but lower than the high intensity group.

We note that the limited range of PEM severity in the low intensity
group (\textasciitilde2.2 to 2.9) may have otherwise caused it to remain
undetected.

\begin{figure}[h]

}

\caption{\label{fig-symptoms}Similar Symptom Domains vs.~PEM}

\end{figure}%

\FloatBarrier

\textbf{Groupings:} From visual inspection of the charts above we group
clusters C9, C19, C26, C28, C31, C36, C37, C40 as high intensity, C2,
C4, C7, C11, C24 as low intensity. We'll keep these groupings for all
plots that follow. The high and low groups are approximately 54.5\% and
45.5\% of the total cohort, respectively.

The last chart (Other vs.~PEM) shows a markedly lower offset and is
perhaps the most visibly obvious difference between the two groups. The
two symptoms in `other' are sensitivity to mold and vibration.

\FloatBarrier

While the groups maintain integrity, the parallelism observed in the
charts above does not hold in the next charts and suggests a more
complex physiological cause for the differences.

\subsection{Increasing Amplification
vs.~PEM}\label{increasing-amplification-vs.-pem}

Pain and neurocognitive domains show that while the low intensity group
remains offset, symptom domain amplification is increased. As PEM
increases to 3, C7 comes very close to the high intensity line.

\begin{figure}[h]

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{VaesSubgroups_files/figure-pdf/neuro_c_symptoms-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-pain}Pain and Neurocognitive vs.~PEM}

\end{figure}%

\FloatBarrier

The two charts above, while not severe enough to claim this is
fibromyalgia with PEM, begin to suggest it.

\subsection{Different Correlations to
PEM}\label{different-correlations-to-pem}

In all of the previous charts we've shown that both groups maintain a
strong but distinct relationship to PEM. By contrast, the immune and
sleep domains show little to no correlation with PEM severity in the low
intensity group. Notably, despite this lack of correlation, sleep
disturbance can be pronounced in the low intensity group.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{VaesSubgroups_files/figure-pdf/immune_symptoms-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-distinct}Immune and Sleep vs.~PEM}

\end{figure}%

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Summary of Differences}\label{summary-of-differences}

\textbf{High Intensity:} Has a consistent amplification pattern: as PEM
increases, all other symptom domains rise together.

\textbf{Low Intensity:} Presents a more selective profile. Pain,
neurocognitive, and neuroendocrine symptoms escalate more rapidly with
PEM, while sleep and immune symptoms show little or no correlation. The
elevated neurocognitive and pain symptoms, together with variable sleep
symptom intensity makes the low-intensity group more suggestive of
fibromyalgia than the high-intensity group. Additionally, the low
intensity group is notably nestled in the middle of the overall PEM
range which could allow it to hide among the other clusters if not
actively searched for.

We summarize these differences in the table below.\bigskip

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\caption{Summary of Group Differences}\label{tbl-t1}\tabularnewline

2.9 \\

Pain & Tracks PEM & Elevated amplification \\
Immune & Tracks PEM & Flat at \textasciitilde1 \\
Sleep & Tracks PEM & \textasciitilde1.4 -- 2.5, but uncorrelated \\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

\textbf{Symptom Severity:} In terms of overall symptom range the two
groups largely overlap. The high intensity group, by symptom intensity
alone, could be considered a superset of the low intensity group. It is
the differing relationships to PEM and the selective amplification of
certain symptom domains in the low intensity group that set the two
groups apart.

\section{Regression Analysis}\label{regression-analysis}

In the preceding section we used visual analysis to identify two
subgroups of ME/CFS patient clusters defined by their symptom domain
profiles relative to PEM severity. Here we focus on quantifying the
value of these groups.

\subsection{R² by Group}\label{ruxb2-by-group}

We compare the regression coefficient (R²) of the symptom domains in
three levels:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Combined (all clusters)
\item
  High intensity group
\item
  Low intensity group
\end{itemize}

We will show that R² is consistently strengthened by removing the low
intensity group, and we'll also show that the high intensity group
maintains a stronger correlation to PEM across most symptom domains.
\FloatBarrier

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-t2}R² by Domain}

\centering{

\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\selectfont
\begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lrrr}
\toprule
Domain & R2\_combined & R2\_high & R2\_low \\ 
\midrule\addlinespace[2.5pt]
All\_mean & 0.91 & 1.00 & 0.84 \\ 
Autonomic & 0.79 & 0.96 & 0.62 \\ 
Fatigue & 0.84 & 0.86 & 0.54 \\ 
Immune & 0.78 & 0.96 & 0.11 \\ 
Neurocognitive & 0.85 & 0.92 & 0.93 \\ 
Neuroendocrine & 0.73 & 0.96 & 0.75 \\ 
Other & 0.52 & 0.92 & 0.96 \\ 
Pain & 0.81 & 0.95 & 0.95 \\ 
Sleep & 0.53 & 0.81 & 0.05 \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}

}

\end{table}%

Table~\ref{tbl-t2} shows that for almost every symptom domain, the high
intensity group has a higher R² than the combined group, which in turn
has a higher R² than the low intensity group. This is consistent with
our visual analysis and supports the existence of two distinct subgroups
within the Vaes clusters.

In some cases, like neurocognitive, neuroendocrine, and Other the
combined R² is significantly weaker than either of the subgroups.

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Leave-one-out Analysis}\label{leave-one-out-analysis}

We discovered our two groups by visual analysis, but we can rediscover
the set using leave-one-out analysis. In this analysis we go through
each domain and examine what happens when we remove one cluster at a
time. The goal is to identify whether removing a cluster improves R² or
makes it worse.

We summarize the mean R² differences, in order of greatest improvement,
in Table~\ref{tbl-t3}. We see that removing any of the low intensity
clusters improves R².

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-t3}Leave-one-out Analysis}

\centering{

\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\selectfont
\begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcrr}
\toprule
Cluster & Group & Domains Improved & Mean ΔR² \\ 
\midrule\addlinespace[2.5pt]
C2 & low & 9 & 0.0379 \\ 
C11 & low & 9 & 0.0271 \\ 
C4 & low & 8 & 0.0191 \\ 
C31 & high & 7 & 0.0163 \\ 
C7 & low & 5 & 0.0129 \\ 
C24 & low & 8 & 0.0126 \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}

}

\end{table}%

Of the top 6 clusters only C31 is not part of the low intensity group.

The \textbf{R² by Group} and \textbf{Leave-one-out Analysis} strongly
support the existence of two distinct subgroups within the Vaes
clusters.

\FloatBarrier

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

We have shown that the Vaes clusters can be organized into two subgroups
defined by symptom domains relative to PEM, and that these subgroups
remain consistent across most symptom domains.

ME/CFS is widely recognized as a heterogeneous condition with complex
symptom presentations. Grouping the Vaes clusters by their relationship
to PEM simplifies this complexity at the domain and cluster levels, but
it only partially reduces heterogeneity at the individual-symptom level
and may not translate directly to grouping individual patients.
Vaes\textsuperscript{1} provided cluster-specific summaries of standout
symptoms; some of those align with our domain-based charts while others
show a different emphasis, underscoring the challenge of reconciling
symptom-level observations with domain-level analyses.

The wide net cast by Vaes in terms of diagnostic criteria may have
helped to reveal these two subgroups. The high intensity group aligns
more closely with classic ME/CFS presentations, while the low intensity
group, with its fibromyalgia-like profile, suggests a different or
overlapping pathophysiology. This is consistent with prior observations
that fibromyalgia and ME/CFS often co-occur and may share underlying
mechanisms.

Although these patterns may guide future phenotyping, several cautions
are warranted. This is a secondary analysis of patient clusters defined
by symptom domains with small subgroup sizes (8 and 5 clusters). The
original clustering methods of Vaes et al.~may have obscured or
exaggerated some relationships we show here. Moreover, visual inspection
of the plots may suggest directional trends where none truly exist.

Despite these limitations, we believe at least two further steps should
be taken. Using the original patient scores could validate, refine, or
repudiate these subgroups and possibly produce a short list of
differentiating symptoms. If this proves useful then examining
biological markers across these subgroups could help to reveal
underlying pathophysiological differences.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Our secondary analysis shows that the many heterogeneous Vaes clusters
can be organized into two broader structures defined by overall symptom
intensity relative to PEM severity. These two groups remain coherent
across symptom domains and display distinct, largely linear
relationships with PEM. Although exploratory and limited to
cluster-level data, these findings offer a reproducible framework that
may help clarify apparent heterogeneity in ME/CFS.

\subsection{Appendix A: Cluster Summary
Data}\label{appendix-a-cluster-summary-data}

We use the Vaes cluster spreadsheet\textsuperscript{2} exclusively as
our data source. We use R for significant cleaning and transformation
from Excel to CSV. After removing everything but the mean severity of
the symptoms in the 13 clusters we:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Group each cluster by symptom domain and calculate geometric means for
  each symptom domain within each cluster.
\item
  Rotate the table
\item
  Add a new column, ``all\_mean'' which is the arithmetic mean of all
  symptoms within each cluster.
\item
  Save this file as cluster\_grouped\_tidy.csv
\end{itemize}

This file is what we then used for our analysis, and the plots. We
present the final data used below. Values were rounded and abbreviations
used for formatting. See the \hyperref[sec-code]{Code Availability}
section for links to the code used to generate this file.
